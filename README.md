# SimplyFeed

Browser extension that filters liked and promoted posts in your LinkedIn feed. Available for download from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplyfeed-linkedin-feed/hpjgkdecioodgjhhdoagefbbdlljkpic) and [Firefox Browser Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/simplyfeed-linkedin-filter/).

# How to develop the extension

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Install [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Load the unpacked extension in the newly-created `build` folder with your Chrome browser; here's [a guide](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/)
5. Copy the extension ID from the loaded extension; here's [a guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8946325/chrome-extension-id-how-to-find-it)
6. Open up [environmentSettings.json](/test/setup/environmentSettings.json) and update `environments.chrome.internalExtensionId` with the extension ID that's generated the first time you

That's it! You can now develop the extension...

- `npm run build` creates the unpacked files in the `build` folder for manually testing the extension as per point 4 above; it also packages the extension in `web-ext-artifcats` so you can submit it to the listings.
- `npm test` runs the [automated tests](#automated-tests)

# To do

## Firefox tests

I previously managed to automate the testing of the extension with Firefox. The tests don't work anymore, I think it has something to do with a recent Firefox update. Here's the steps I took to make it work in the past:

1. Install [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver).
2. Install [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) using [this guide](https://medium.com/@js_debugger/how-to-install-firefox-developer-edition-on-ubuntu-1c7f5f2b6883). If you don't follow the guide, make sure you set `options.setProfile` in [firefoxEnvironment.js](test/setup/firefoxEnvironment.js) to the path for Firefox Developer Edition's executable.
3. Disable signature checking for add-ons in the Firefox Developer Edition installation. [Here's](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31952728) how you do it.
4. Update the following values in the `firefox` key inside [environmentSettings.json](test/setup/environmentSettings.json)...
   1. `internalExtensionId` - see how it was done for Chrome
   2. `options.setBinary` - location of the Firefox Developer Edition executable
   3. `options.setProfile` - the folder name in `~/.mozilla/firefox` that ends in `.dev-edition-default`. This folder holds the default profile for your Firefox Developer Edition Installation.
5. Add this key/value pair to the first-level object `manifest.json` when developing locally:
   ```
   {
      "browser_specific_settings": {
        "gecko": {
          "id": "addon@example.com",
          "strict_min_version": "42.0"
        }
      }
   }
   ```
6. Uncomment the Firefox-related key-value pair in [jest.config.js](jest.config.js)

## Content script tests

The `content.js` and `contentTest.js` files refer to several automated tests I set up for the content script which used to work. I encountered several challenges when open-sourcing these files, however, which eventually led me to set them aside.

You'll notice that the tests have the browser go to the actual LinkedIn site; a huge no-no as you shouldn't be incorporating external dependencies. I tried avoiding this by running the tests on a mock HTML page (i.e. downloading the LinkedIn feed page for my account). But the content scripts wouldn't get activated for some reason. The issue doesn't lie with the trigger in `manifest.json`, which I managed to get to work by adding `"file:///*/linkedin_mock.html"` (the name of my mock HTML page) to `content_scripts.matches`.

I think it has something to do with the fact that the `chrome.webNavigation.onHistoryStateUpdated` callback in [helpers.js](src/pages/Background/modules/helpers.js) doesn't get activated when you go to the mock page. The callback sits in the [background scripts](src/pages/Background) and sends an alert to the content scripts which, in turn, triggers the filtering. The reason I didn't just put the trigger in the content scripts is because it sometimes misses out when you go to the LinkedIn feed.

The next major difficulty was having the Selenium-driven browsers log onto the live LinkedIn site. I got this to work on Firefox by starting every browser instance with a specific profile that was already logged in. Unfortunately that's [not possible ](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34737733/7874516) with Chrome; the only alternative would've been to read the username and password from a file that sits outside of the repository - needless to say how insecure that would've been :)

The final problem was the huge amount of time it takes to fully load a LinkedIn page; I had to extend the timeout for Jest to 20 minutes :D. Even then, the tests would throw false negatives because the website is very volatile.

# Other

Might be sometimes out of sync with the code used in the Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons listings. This will happen when I make changes that don't have bearing to the extension's functionality (e.g. tests) and I can't be bothered to go through the process of updating the extension listings.
